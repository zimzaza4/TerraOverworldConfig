# Features

This directory contains all feature configs, which are used by biomes to
determine *what* structures will generate, and *where* they generate.

You can find biome configs utilizing the features here within the `biomes`
directory.

Structure configuration (such as trees, boulders, etc) can be found in the
`structures` directory. The subdirectories here roughly match that of the
`structures` directory, such that you can locate relevant structures defined
inside feature configs the by following the same path through the `structures`
directory.
