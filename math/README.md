# Math

This directory contains commonly used mathematical functions and noise samplers,
with the intent of being utilized globally across the entire pack. These
functions and samplers are defined in their own files for the sake of
organization, and are injected into the pack manifest, rather than being
directly defined in it.

Things are only defined here if they are commonplace across different
configurations, more specific single application functions and samplers should
be defined where they are used instead of here.
